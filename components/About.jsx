              Hey üëã! I'm Vishnu, a 20-year-old based in India.¬†I'm currently
              pursuing Engineering Design from{" "}

                IIT Madras
              </a>
              . I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been
              passionate about it ever since. I started out building websites
              using no-code tools back in 2012, infact i still remember
              deploying my{" "}

              ,though it was just a really basic one, it still got a special
              place in my ‚ù§Ô∏è.

            <p>
              And later on, I taught myself how to code, fast-forward to today,
              I do programming in various languages and technologies. I'm
              interested in building something awesome with code and automate
              tasks with code, currently focused on{" "}
              <span className="text-blue-300">
                Web & Mobile Full-Stack Development.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, binge
              shows/movies, sit down for a good game of chess, or if the
              weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ I also love listening to
              Hip-Hop, Pop & Lo-Fi music.
