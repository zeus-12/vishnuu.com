            Hey! I'm Vishnu Vinod, I've been close to a computer since an early
            age, and been really passionate about it ever since. I‚Äôve always
            loved creating something cool, and where else than in the internet
            itself.

            I started out building websites using no-code tools back in 2014,
            infact i still remember deploying my{" "}
            <a className="text-blue-300" href="https://speedcubing3.weebly.com">
              first website
            </a>{" "}
            on Weebly ,though it was just a really basic one, it still got a
            special place in my heart. And later on, I taught myself how to
            code, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages
            and technologies.

            I'm interested in building something awesome with code and automate
            tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile Development.

            When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, binge shows/movies
            online, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ¬†or sit down
            for a good game of chess. I also love listening to music. I mainly
            listen to Hip-Hop, Pop and Lofi songs
