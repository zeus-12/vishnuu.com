The following CSS code snippet can be used to create a grid-wrap-like property using CSS grid:

```css
.grid-wrap {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(200px, 100%), 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

Provides a Grid container with columns that dynamically adjust based on available space.
The columns will have a minimum width of 200 pixels and expand equally to fill any additional space. The gap property sets a 1-rem gap between grid items.
